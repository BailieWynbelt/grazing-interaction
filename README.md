# Horse-Cattle-Elk Grazing Interaction Study

In this repository we host our R scripts, Perl scripts, and Bulk Rename Command Line scripts that we use for ingesting data, extracting metadata, replicating data, organizing data, cleaning data, and analyzing data. Our data types are primarily photos from camera traps, both timelapse photos and motion-captures, and vegetation data from various vegetation data collection methods. The data is offline and requires that the pricipal investigator makes the data available to you. We plan to make our data publicly available when we publish our results in an academic journal. Each data package contains detailed metadata set in the Ecological Metadata Language (EML).
