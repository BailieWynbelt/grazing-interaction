# Horse-Cattle-Elk Grazing Interaction Study

[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

## About this Repo

In this repository we host scripts that we use for ingesting data, extracting metadata, replicating data, organizing data, cleaning data, and analyzing data. Generally, these scripts are not intended for public consumption, but if you find them uselful for your research, feel free to re-use them (see LICENSE).

## About Our Research

We research the effects of grazing animals on the environment, in many different forms. This repo is primarily aimed at researching the interactions grazing animals have between conspecifics (same species, between individuals), and the interactions grazing animals have between different species (e.g. cows vs. horses). 

Our data are primarily photos from camera traps, both timelapse photos and motion-captures. We also collect vegetation data using the stubble height, landscape appearance, and paired-plot methods. The data is offline and requires that the pricipal investigator makes the data available to you. We plan to make our data publicly available when we publish our results in an academic journal.
