What am I trying to do?

I want to have a status tracking for each collection folder on a Kanban board.

1. re-tag all tasks by status (e.g., #metadata #rename)
2. use dataview or another plugin to get all of the tags related to particular task (or do I link?)
3. add the task to the kanban board
4. when the task is completed, tag it with the new status
5. move it to the next position on the kanban board
6.
