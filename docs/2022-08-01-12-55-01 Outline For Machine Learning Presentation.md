1. Problem Statement
	1. What problem/challenge are we trying to solve?
		1. data management and analysis of large data sets
	2. Why is this a problem?
		1. current methods take alot of personnel time (and therefore money) to process photos from camera traps
2. Our Solution
	1. Basics- how does it work? (keep it simple and very top-level, avoid jargon)
	2. Output- what data does it generate?
		1. examples
			1. `output.json`
			2. processed images with bounding boxes
		2. speed
			1. how fast are photos processed?
				1. compare with times estimates provided by Andrew
	3. Limitations
		1. What doesnâ€™t it do (currently)?
			1. no species-level identification
3. Future Steps
	1. scaling algorithm to run on all data
		1. challenges related to scaling
			1. costs and complexities related to scaling
			2. where to run? Cyverse, XSEDE
	2. individual species identification
		1. challenges related to training our own model
