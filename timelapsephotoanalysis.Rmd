```{r}
# load packages and dependencies
library("ggplot2", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("dplyr", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("jpeg", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("viridis", lib.loc = "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("scales", lib.loc = "~/R/win-library/3.5")
```
First, let's get our R environment ready by loading some useful packages.


```{r}
# clear the enviroment
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
```
Then, let's remove all objects from the environment to start fresh each time.


```{r}
# check working directory
getwd()
```
Let's check the working directory to see if it's correct.
