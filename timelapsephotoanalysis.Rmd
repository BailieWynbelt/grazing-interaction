R Markdown Instructions

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

Timelapse Photo Data Pre-Processing

First, let's get our R environment ready by loading some useful packages.
```{r}
library("ggplot2", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("dplyr", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("jpeg", lib.loc= "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("viridis", lib.loc = "~/R/win-library/3.5")
library("scales", lib.loc = "~/R/win-library/3.5")
```

Then, let's remove all objects from the environment to start fresh each time.
```{r}
## clear the enviroment
rm(list=ls(all=TRUE))
```

Let's check the working directory to see if it's correct.
```{r}
getwd()
```
