## Step 5: Convert Excel Scoring Macro (XLSM) to CSV and Recombine CSV Chunks

## What this script does:
## Scans a file directory for XLSM files (hopefully completed XLSM)
## Converts XLSM files to CSV
## Recombines chunked CSV files (i.e. chunk1.csv, chunk2.csv, chunk3.csv) into a single CSV file
## Writes out a single CSV file containing all chunks for a collection

## What this script requires:
## Must specify the location of the folder containing XLSM files
## Must specify where to write out CSV files
